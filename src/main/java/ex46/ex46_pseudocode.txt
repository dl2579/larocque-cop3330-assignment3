Use FileIO to read input file
Create a TreeMap with String as the key and integer(frequency) as the value
Read each line from input file and put into string array of words
for each element of the string array, if the tree map does not contain the string, write it to the tree map with a frequency of 1
    else increment the integer (value) by 1
Find entry with max frequency by looping through all entries and comparing the value of the entries
Use for loops to add stars to output string for frequency value of max entry
Print max entry key and output stars
remove max entry from tree map
repeat until no entries left in tree map
